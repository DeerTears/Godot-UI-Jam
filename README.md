# Godot-UI-Jam
GUJ for short. A group project with friends.

# Goals
General:
- Experiment with UI polish

Ember:
- Keep UiState in a separate container to reduce state management problems
- Handling save files
- Making controller-friendly save slots
- Autosave, how fragile is it?
- Adding screen transitions

Bricks:
- saving and loading data
- settings
- key remapping
- linking outside of project (e.g. to the steam page for wishlisting)
- Probably some other stuff skipping my mind atm

eggwhites:
- UI theming/styles
